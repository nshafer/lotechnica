This is a test first article.  Woot!

### Content

Content will `go` here.

	:::python
	print("This is a test bit of code")

and another

	#!python
	def test():
		print("This is another test")

test Elixir:

	:::elixir
	def fun(opts) do
		IO.puts "test #{opts.name}"
		list = ~w(test list)
		[test list]
		regex = ~r/test/
		foo = "bar"
		baz = 1
	end

Test MathJax

This is a test of inline math: $_\text{c} = (\pi/4) d^2$ did it work?

What about a block?

$$
α_t(i) = P(O_1, O_2, … O_t, q_t = S_i λ)
$$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

test greek: $\beta$

Matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
