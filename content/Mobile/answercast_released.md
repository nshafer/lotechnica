I’m happy to finally announce the release of my little pet-project, AnswerCast.  The app is now available on Google Play and the iTunes App Store.

In short it’s an app that enhances the experience when playing certain family/board games such as The Game of Things, Balderdash, Loaded Questions and others.  Submit your answers with your smartphone or tablet to a Google Cast device which then scrambles them and displays them on your TV.

I first came up with this years ago and even wrote a prototype that allowed you to text your answers to a phone number, and then display them on a TV with a connected laptop.  However, this solution was not practical for the average user.  So then recently I realized I could use (or abuse) a Chromecast to do the same thing while giving me an opportunity to learn how to develop native apps, and hence the project was born.

So if you happen to be in the small niche of people who like these kinds of board games, have a Google Cast device such as a Chromecast or Nexus Player, and all of your players have an Android or iOS phone or tablet, then this is the app for you!
