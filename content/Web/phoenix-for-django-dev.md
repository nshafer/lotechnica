I've been playing around with the new [Phoenix Framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) which is based on the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) language.  So far I'm very impressed and thinking of using it for some upcoming projects.  I come into this from the Django world, and I've mostly done object oriented or imperative programming in my career, so functional is a new paradigm for me.
